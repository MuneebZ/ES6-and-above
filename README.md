Personal notes for ECMAScript 6+

These notes follow the LinkedIn learning course "Learning ECMAScript 6+ (ES6+)" by Eve Porcello. 

From the course, the description reads as follows:

ECMAScript—the standardized version of JavaScript—keeps getting more powerful. ES6 was a large leap forward, introducing features that changed how 
developers structure programs. But every year since there have been updates and additional improvements. This course helps you create modern 
JavaScript applications leveraging the most interesting and useful features in ES6+. Eve Porcello introduces the new keywords and operators that can
help simplify code, as well as new ways of creating functions and objects. She also shows you how to write and search through template strings, 
create map objects to store key/value pairs, move values from one array to another—or one object to another—with the spread operator, build 
reusable classes, and use arrow functions and generators. Plus, learn how to handle asynchronous data and tasks with promises, fetch, and the 
async/await syntax.

The earning objectives as stated are:

- What is ECMAScript?
- Writing and searching strings
- Writing maps
- Destructuring arrays
- Searching arrays
- Creating objects
- Destructuring objects
- Iterating with the for/of loop
- Getting and setting class values
- Using ECMAScript functions
- Building and returning promises
- Using async/await syntax
